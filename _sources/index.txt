******************************************************************************
geodas - Geospatial Data Analysis in Python
******************************************************************************

.. note::

   |geodas| is work in progress! Currently, it does not provide anything
   useful ... yet.

|geodas| is a Python_ library aimed at the analysis of geospatial data. Its 
main purpose is the handling of large 4-dimensional datasets (time, altitude,
longitude, latitude), as are common in atmospheric science. The library is
geared towards easy interactive use, i.e. in combination with ipython_.
Development of |geodas| takes place at GitHub_.
