geodas - Geospatial Data Analysis in Python
===========================================

**geodas** is work in progress! Currently, it does not provide anything
useful ... yet.

**geodas** is a Python library aimed at the analysis of geospatial data. Its 
main purpose is the handling of large 4-dimensional datasets (time, altitude,
longitude, latitude), as are common in atmospheric science. The library is
geared towards easy interactive use, i.e. in combination with ipython.
